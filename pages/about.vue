        I believe people with passion can change the world and if you are one of
        those believers then you are part of my tribe. Tredwear is born out of
        my passion for shoes & a promise I made to myself, to create high
        quality, true value shoes based on my 22+ years of shoe design knowledge
        and experience working with multiple world famous brands.

        I grew up with next to nothing, all I had was love from my family and
        friends, and a talent to create and sketch designs. I worked hard,
        learnt and improved drastically and I soon found my way to the top. But
        the top was not just enough, I wanted to mean more than just a sack of
        profit to business organisations, I wanted my products to represent more
        than profit and marginalisation. So, I decided to start all over again,
        with the creation of Tredwear.

        motto. It represents the true spirit of sportsmanship, the urge to
        perform in any field/ activity with undiluted passion. Its Focus is on
        strength of character and attitude. Tredwear was created by me to
        enhance belief in self and confidence. I want to see you excel without
        losing yourself, Tredwear wants to be your backbone and your source of
        inspiration, not just a brand, a movement, a movement of hardworking and
